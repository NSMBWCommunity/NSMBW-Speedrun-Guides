# Practice
While NSMBW might look difficult on the surface, nothing in this game cant be learned, and made consistent with "good practice".
Knowing how to effectively practice NMSBW is what will keep you from platowing and help you to continuously improve your times.

## Practice Mod
The practice mod for NSMBW can be used on all platforms with homebrew setup.
Homebrew is really easy to setup on Wii and is fairly simple on WiiU.

The practice Mod uses a Homebrew App called [Riivolution](https://aerialx.github.io/rvlution.net/riivolution.zip){: .btn }  
To use this mod download and open the newest version of the practice mod zip/rar located in the [Resources Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/135832360099774464/1033932077890027561){: .btn }  

Drag both folders onto the Root of your homebrew SD card and load riivolution.

## Info Display
MGR's Info Display is a very good tool to have on while doing practice.

This display uses the black space of the 4:3 resolution to dispaly important info about mario's current state.
Features
- Decimal IGT
- Input Display
- Mario's x and y Speed
- Mario's Current state(Jumping, Falling, Sliding, etc)

The Info display is installed the same way as the practice mod. The newest version is pinned in the general channel of the NSMBW Server
