# Practice
While NSMBW might look difficult on the surface, nothing in this game can’t be learned, and made consistent with "good practice".
Knowing how to effectively practice NSMBW is what will keep you from plateauing and help you to continuously improve your times.

## Practice Mod
The practice mod for NSMBW can be used on all platforms with homebrew set up.
Homebrew is really easy to set up on Wii and is fairly simple on WiiU.

The practice Mod uses a Homebrew App called 
[Riivolution](https://aerialx.github.io/rvlution.net/riivolution.zip){: .btn }  
To use this mod download and open the newest version of the practice mod zip/rar located in the [Resources Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/135832360099774464/1033932077890027561)

Drag both folders onto the Root of your homebrew SD card and load riivolution.

## Info Display
MGR's Info Display is a very good tool to have on while doing practice.
