# 1-2
1-2 is a very straightforward level so its only broken down to 2 tiers that are pretty similar. The "Beginner" tier of this level is what everyone does, and there is no reason to drop anything for a newer player. The "Expert" tier features a strat called Gzord kicks which saves a small ammount of time.
