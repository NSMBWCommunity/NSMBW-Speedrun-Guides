# 5-1

The main tech in this level is called neutral vines. The let you get up to 4 speed in the air after jumping off the vines.
Neutral Vine Inputs: Hold right and Jump then the next frame you go neutral and hold it until the next vine/ the ground that you land on.
Make sure to NOT go neutral before you jump of the vine or you will get low speed. Each frame after the first frame marios speed drops a little from 4 speed, which makes a much better to aim for going neutral a couple frame later until you get a good feeling for how early you can do it.
