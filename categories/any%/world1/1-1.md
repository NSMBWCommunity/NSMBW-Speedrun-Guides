# 1-1 
While on the surface 1-1 is a pretty simple level it is a great level to start learning the intricacies of NSMBW movement. Sliding down slopes is used throughout the speedrun to move faster than Mario's normal full running speed of 3 units/frame referred to as 3 speed normally.

## Slopes and Rolling Hills

Its only faster to slide down slopes that are less steep than 45% or 1x2 in terms of blocks in NSMBW.
When sliding down slopes it's usually important to slide on the ground after the slope for a bit to get full advantage of the slope speed. Looking at the speed display in the example videos, and in your own practice can be a great way to get used to how far on the flat ground you should continue sliding.

Jumping over upwards slopes is just as if not more important than sliding down slopes in NSMBW. If it's possible to jump over an upwards slope it's almost always faster to jump over it. If you are forced to land on an upwards slope it's important to jump off it as fast as possible.

If a rolling hill is moving to the right you want to walk onto it and then jump until the hill is a downwards slope, then walk down it and jump at the end. When jumping off certain rolling hills you get to maintain the slope's speed, so you want to try to stay in the air for as long as possible.
