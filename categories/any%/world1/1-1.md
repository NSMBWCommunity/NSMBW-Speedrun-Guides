# 1-1 
While on the surface, 1-1 is a pretty simple level. It is a great level to start learning the intricacies of NSMBW movement. The first to learn of many is that sliding down slopes and running/jumping off rolling hills is used throughout this level to move faster than Mario's normal full running speed of 3 units/frame (referred to as "3 speed").

In 1-1, you power-up to big Mario with the midway flag and grab one of two propellor mushrooms from subsequent ?-blocks.
