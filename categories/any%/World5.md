# World 5 

In World 5, it is ideal to keep your propellor mushroom the entire time. Because of how much the propellor power-up saves, it is recommended for beginners to first get comfortable with keeping prop, then start learning more advanced strategies.

For beginners, a good World 5 split (5-Cannon fadeout) should be in the mid-12:00 zone. More experienced runners should aim for a 12:0X split, and top-level runners go for sub-12 minute splits.
