# Movement

Movement in this game is quite intuitive once you get the hang of it. Understanding the physics and using the info display mod will greatly help you improve at speedrunning this game.

There is no relevant framerule system in this game, so the goal for every level is to always reach the goal as quick as possible. That means in most instances, we always want to be maximizing Mario's X-speed in horizontal levels, and Y-speed in vertical levels.

## Speed

At maximum regular running speed, Mario moves 3 pixes per frame, or *3 speed*. There are many techniques to increase this speed or avoid losing it.

### Sliding Down Slopes

It fastest to slide down slopes that are less steep than 45 degrees (1x2 or 1x4 in terms of blocks).

When sliding down slopes it's usually important to slide on the ground after the slope for a bit to get full advantage of the slope speed. Looking at the speed display in the example videos and in your own practice can be a great way to get used to how far on the flat ground you should continue sliding. For 45 degree slopes, it is fastest to run down these and slide at the last moment and on the flat ground for a bit.

Running up upwards slopes is slow. Avoid them if possible. If you are forced to land on an upwards slope, jump off as quick as possible.

### Moving Platforms

There are many types of moving platforms/ground in this game. A good rule of thumb for both is to run on any platform that is moving in your desired direction.
There are essentially two types of moving ground:

1) **Ground that carries your momentum**
2) **Ground that *doesn't* carry your momentum**

### 1. Ground That Carries Your Momentum

#### Some examples of moving ground that carry your speed when jumping off of them.
The first you will have to deal with are rolling hills.
When running on rolling hills, your speed changes based on the speed/direction of the rolling hill.

To maximize the speed from forward rolling hills, run onto it as early as possible then jump off of it as late as possible and stay in the air as long as possible to maintain its speed. Twirling in midair (if you aren't propellor Mario) will help you stay in the air for longer.

Similarly, backwards rolling hills will decrease your speed while running/jumping off of them. There are two ways to deal with these slopes by "cancelling" the speed of the hill you're on and returning to 3 speed.
1) Crouch jumping off of a slope and uncrouching mid-air will neutralize your speed.
2) Shooting a projectile (fire or ice, ideally immediately before jumping) will neutralize your speed.

Of course, your speed will revert to the speed of the rolling hill (or 3 speed if on normal ground) as soon as you land.
