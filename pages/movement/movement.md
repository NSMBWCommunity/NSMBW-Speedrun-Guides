# Movement

Movement in this game is quite intuitive once you get the hang of it. Understanding the physics and using the info display mod will greatly help you improve at speedrunning this game.

First, some ground rules when talking about movement in this game.

1) If controls are mentioned, sideways Wii remote is assumed.

2) "Blocks" refer to the tiling system this game's levels are built with. 2 "blocks" wil refer to 2 "tiles."

</div>

3) Holding "run" while running is always assumed, unless otherwise stated.
4) 

There is no relevant framerule system in this game, so the goal for every level is to always reach the goal as quick as possible. That means in most instances, we always want to be maximizing Mario's X-speed in horizontal levels, and Y-speed in vertical levels.

## Speed

At maximum regular running speed, Mario moves 3 pixes per frame, or *3 speed*. There are many techniques to increase this speed or avoid losing it.

### Sliding Down Slopes

It fastest to slide down slopes that are less steep than 45 degrees (if solid ground, only slide down 1x2 or 1x4 slopes).

</div>

When sliding down slopes it's usually important to slide on the ground after the slope for a bit to get full advantage of the slope speed. Looking at the speed display in the example videos and in your own practice can be a great way to get used to how far on the flat ground you should continue sliding. For 45 degree slopes, it is fastest to run down these and slide at the last moment and on the flat ground for a bit.

Running up upwards slopes is slow. Avoid them if possible. If you are forced to land on an upwards slope, jump off as quick as possible.

### Moving Platforms

There are many examples of moving platforms/ground in this game, including rolling hills, line-controlled blocks, and floating platforms. **A good rule of thumb for these is to run on any ground that is moving in your desired direction.**

Some moving ground/platforms can affect your speed im the air after jumping off of them. Let's take a closer look at these:

### 1. Ground That *Does* Affect Your Air Speed

<div class="gif-container">

</div>

Moving platforms/ground that will affect your speed in the air include **rolling hills, conveyor belts, the bone coaster, and big ice blocks.**

To maximize the speed from these ground types, run onto them as early as possible then jump off of as late as possible, staying in the air as long as possible. Twirling (if you aren't propellor Mario) will help you stay in the air for longer.

Similarly, backwards moving ground and rolling hills will decrease your speed while running/jumping off of them.

For all backwards moving ground of this type, there are two ways to jump off and "cancel" the speed of the ground you're on and return to 3 speed:

1) **Crouch jumping and uncrouching mid-air.** Crouch jumping off of a steep portion of a rolling hill requires a frame-perfect down+jump input, so aim for the peak of a rolling hill for a more lenient crouch jump.

</div>

2) **Shooting fire or ice (ideally immediately before jumping).** The position on the hill/platform does not matter; this technique is essentially free and is faster because you don't have to wait until the peak of your jump to regain speed.

    </div>

Of course, your speed will revert to the speed of the moving ground (or 3 speed if on normal ground) as soon as you land.

### 2. Ground That Does *Not* Affect Your Air Speed

</div>
    these sideways-moving platforms appear in many horizontal levels including 2-2, 7-3, and 9-3.


Any **line-controlled blocks/platforms, rotating blocks, and floating platforms** will *not* affect your speed when you jump off of them. They still change your speed when running on them.

Follow the rule of thumb and run on them while they are moving in your desired direction. Jumping off will immediately revert you to 3 speed regardless of which direction the ground is moving.
