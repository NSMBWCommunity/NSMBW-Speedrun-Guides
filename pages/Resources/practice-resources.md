An installation for just the Info Display on the top of the screen. Includes Mario's X/Y speed, precise IGT, an input display, Mario's current movement state, and a power-up-specific frame timer. This mod is pinned in the NSMBW Speedrunning Server `#general` channel.

---

[ILs Mod](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/NSMBW-ILs-Mod){: .btn}

The mod legal for IL Runs on [Speedrun.com](speedrun.com). Under "Features" in the `README` on this page has all the info you need!

## Software

[Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/){: .btn }

The best Wii (and Gamecube) emulator. Plenty of tutorials are on YouTube for setup. Great for efficient practice if you're okay with a small input delay.

---

[AmaRecTV](https://www.videohelp.com/software/AmaRecTV){: .btn }

Software used for instant-replay. Has built-in frame advance and slow down which is super useful for analyzing gameplay and understanding movement. Program documentation is limited due to it being pretty old and developed in Japanese.
