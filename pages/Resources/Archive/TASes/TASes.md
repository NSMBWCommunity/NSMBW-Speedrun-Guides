A TAS, or Tool-Assisted Speedrun, is a speedrun created using tools like slowdown, frame advance, and RNG manipulation to create a theoretically perfect speedrun. These are maticulously made by people using tools like emulators and custom scripts.

Here you can find TASes grouped by category, then sorted by descending chronological order. Start by picking a category from the table of contents.
