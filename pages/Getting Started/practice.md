# Practice

While NSMBW might look difficult on the surface, nothing in this game can’t be learned and made consistent with *good* practice.

Knowing how to effectively practice NSMBW is what will keep you from plateauing and help you to continuously improve your times.

If you're looking for a plain list of practice resource links, head to [Practice Resources](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/resources/practice-resources).

## Practice Mod 

The **Practice Mod** is the best way to practice this game. It is packed with a multitude of features, including:

- Pipes placed throughout almost every level for quick access to rooms that may typically take a long time to reach. In 8-Airship, there is a pipe at the start of the level that takes you directly to the Bowser Jr. fight.

- Certain button combinations are hardcoded in for savestates, zooming in/out, power-up cycling, and instant room reloading. Here is the full list of features with their respective button combo:

| Action | Sideways Wiimote ("A") | Sideways Wiimote ("B") | Wiimote + Nunchuk |
| - | - | - | - |
| Save state | Minus | Minus | Minus |
| Restore state | A | B | C |
| Reload room (return to original position) | Minus + 1 | Minus + 1 | Minus + B |
| Reload room (keep current position) | Minus + 2 | Minus + 2 | Minus + A |
| Cycle powerup | Minus + B | Minus + A | Minus + Z |
| Toggle star | Minus + D-Pad Up | Minus + D-Pad Up | Minus + Joystick Up |
| Reload stage | Minus + D-Pad Down | Minus + D-Pad Down | Minus + Joystick Down |
| Zoom out | Plus + D-Pad Up | Plus + D-Pad Up | Plus + D-Pad Up |
| Zoom in | Plus + D-Pad Down | Plus + D-Pad Down | Plus + D-Pad Down |
| Toggle zoom | Plus + D-Pad Left | Plus + D-Pad Left | Plus + D-Pad Left |
| Default zoom | Plus + D-Pad right | Plus + D-Pad right | Plus + D-Pad right |
| Visualize Hitboxes | B + 2 | B + 2 | B + 2 |

- An info display at the top of the screen provides real-time useful info including X/Y speed, precise IGT, an input display, Mario's current movement state, and a power-up-specific frame timer (more info can be found throughout the [Movement Guide](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/movement)).

## Installation

NSMBW mods require installing [Homebrew](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup) to your Wii/Wii U.

Linked are easy-to-follow Homebrew setup tutorials for: 
- [Wii](https://youtu.be/bHGf7JbQR9c)
- [Wii U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTJ3cShA6AI).

All NSMBW mods launch using a Homebrew app called 
[Riivolution](https://aerialx.github.io/rvlution.net/wiki/Riivolution/).

After having a Homebrewed console with Riivolution:

1) Download and open the latest Practice Mod .zip file, located in the [Discord Server #resources Channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/135832360099774464/1033932077890027561)

2) Drag the `Roadrunner_Rynnoo_Edit` and `riivolution` folders onto the root of your SD card and hit "Replace Files" if a prompt shows up.

3) Safely eject your SD card from your computer and insert it into your Wii/Wii U console.

4) Open the Riivolution app from the Wii Menu, make sure "NSMBW Practice Mode" is the only mod set to `ENABLED`, and hit `LAUNCH`.

This same installation process can be applied to all NSMBW Mods. Navigate Riivolution by using the Wii Remote dpad or cursor.
