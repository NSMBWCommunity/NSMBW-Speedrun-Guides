# Neutral Tricks

Oftentimes in NSMBW, if you get a lot of speed, you can preserve it while in midair by letting go of the D-pad, or "going neutral." Let's study the different instances where we can take advantage of this!

## Vines, (Chains), and Ladders

Vines and chains initially give you a lot of speed when you jump off at a desirable velocity. To keep that speed, let go of the dpad right AFTER you jump off. Make sure you are holding left or right while holding the vine and press `2` to dismount.

## Enemy Boosts

If you get speed in certain ways, you can preserve your speed by chaining jumps off of enemies while staying neutral.

### Slope boosts

We have learned that running and sliding on slopes is fast. 

As seen in 1-1, you can get a boost from a goomba right after the checkpoint. This is done by getting a frame-perfect `2` press to bounce off of the goomba while Mario's speed is still above 3.0 from running/sliding off the slope. If you get a boost, stay neutral until landing. Chaining bounces off of enemies will maintain that speed. Pressing `left` or `right` will deccelerate you back to a max of 3 speed.

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: rgba(56, 165, 255, 0.9);"></i> <i> This has to be frame-perfect, because typically when you jump off of a slope, you immediately revert to 3 speed. Also, as long as you're not small/mini Mario, **sliding will ensure you will not take damage to attemping goomba boost.**</i>

### Propellor Boosts

We know that jumping off of a slope while Mario has over 3 speed will revert his speed to 3.0 as soon as he jumps.  However, propellor spinning off of slopes and rolling hills deccelerates Mario at a slower rate, thus carrying the speed slightly longer through the spin. So, if you can manage to bounce off of an enemy while spinning, which is in most cases frame-perfect, and Mario has greater than 3.0 speed, he will stay at that speed until touching the ground.
