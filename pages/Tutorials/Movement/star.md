# Star

Star power is almost always worth getting because of the speed advantage it gives you. Your max ground running speed is 4.0 and Mario becomes invincible to enemies for the duration of the star power. Star power lasts _ frames.

Some movement that is faster is still faster to do with star, and some moveemnt is slower with star. Knowing how to move differently with star power is vital to learning categories like Any%.

## Pipekicks

You *do* accelerate significantly faster with star power, but *wallkicking is still the fastest way* to reach max 4 speed.

## Slopes

The number one slope rule with star is to *not slide*. Sliding takes away your star speed.

You *do* want to run down slopes less steep than 45 degrees. You will keep 4 speed and gain more as you run down gentle slopes.

Do *not* run down steep slopes unless you are going for...

## Hyperspeed

To acquire hyperspeed:

1. Run down a slope to accelerate to over 4.0 running speed.

2. Penguin slide and quickly jump. You will now maintain this >4.0 speed horizontally as long as you are in the air.

3. Chain jumps, jumping off of the ground as quickly as possible. Sliding on the ground will lose speed.

Star is usually fastest for horizontal movement. Propellor is usually fastest for vertical movement, so let's learn how it works.
