# Propeller

Propeller is the most important powerup to understand for Any%, and is still very relevant for every other category besides Low%.

Using the propeller powerup requires using motion controls. You will often hear about runners "dropping spins" or getting "delayed spins" because of the accelerometer in the wii remote not being reliable. Motion control sensitivity can vary between wii remotes as well. To get motion inputs (commonmly called 'spinputs') more consistently, we recommend shaking with your left hand, or the hand on the side with the dpad.

## General Usage

As a reminder, spinning up gives Mario `2.5` X-speed and `2.5` Y-speed. Falling from a propellor spin puts Mario at `1.5` X-speed. To fall slower with propellor, continuously shake the Wiimote to go from `-1.25` to `-1.0` Y-speed.

Spin-drilling is done by pressing `DOWN` after spinning and being high enough above the ground below you. This will make Mario move downward with `-4.0` Y-speed, the same Y-speed as ground-pounding. Note that you cannot slightly move left or right while spin-drilling like you can while ground-pounding.  

Becuase your max X-speed goes from `3.0` to `2.5` when spinning, the goal is to minimize propellor spinning in horizontal levels. Falling to the ground after prop spinning is slow (`1.5` X-speed and `-1.0` Y-speed) and spin-drilling is usually slow too, so let's talk about a few ways to cancel a prop spin.

## Throwing

One of the most common ways we cancel a prop spin is by throwing something, usually an enemy. Optimally we want to spin as little as possible and hover after throwing to maximize vertical height.

</div>
<i><small>Notice Mario's speed accelerate from `2.5` to `3.0` after throwing the buzzy beetle. This is "8-1 shellboost" and was the first strat that used throwing to cancel a spin.</small></i>

## Wallkicking

If there is a wall near the peak of your spin, wallkicking is almost the fastest way to continue upward. Keep in mind that you have to be near the peak of your spin in order to initiate a wallkick.

<div class="gif-container">
  <img src="" alt="5-T 556 wallkick">
</div>
<i><small>This wallkick's timing is hard to get down at first but is essential to getting "556" in 5-Tower.</small></i>

## Instant-Landing

Instant-lands have been implemented in most vertical levels. This technique negates the need for any space between Mario and the ground. There are two types of platforms that allow for instant-landing.

### Lifts

You can easily instant-land on pass-through lifts like basic yellow platforms and mushrooms. Simply prop spin from below the platform and press `DOWN` as Mario's feet approach the platform.
