# Main Board Categories

The table of contents includes links to tutorials for all of the main leaderboard categories.

## The Basics

**Start recording before the World 1 map appears on your screen.** If you are doing **Super Guide Manip**, include that in your recording.

Every category begins when you move on the World 1 map on an exmpty file. 

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #007bff;"></i> <i>Pausing, pressing `-`, `HOME`, or `A` before entering 1-1 will count towards your time. It is worth it to reset if an accidental input happends before your run begins. </i>

Every category except 100% ends on the frame `8000` appears when you hit the button at the end of 8-Castle. You must survive after hitting the switch for the run to count.

100% runs end on the frame the `You've completed everything in New Super Mario Bros. Wii!` textbox appears.

Before doing any attempts, please review both the **Game Rules** and **Category Rules** on [Speedrun.com](speedrun.com/nsmbw).
