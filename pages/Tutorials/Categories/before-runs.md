# Before Doing Runs

Please first review both the **Game Rules** and **Category Rules** on [Speedrun.com](speedrun.com/nsmbw).

## Reminders

When playing, we advise to **always be recording.**

When uploading/submitting your run, include footage before the World 1 map appears on your screen. If you are doing **Super Guide Manip**, include that in your recording.

Splits are not required in your recording. Leave gameplay unobstructed by any element in your layout.

Please upload your runs to YouTube for retiming and accessibility purposes.

## Starting/Ending Runs

Every category begins on the frame Mario moves on the World 1 map on an empty file. 

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #007bff;"></i> <i>Pausing, pressing `-`, `HOME`, or `A` before entering 1-1 will count towards your time. It is worth it to reset if an accidental input happends before your run begins. </i>

Every category except 100% ends on the frame `8000` appears when you hit the button at the end of 8-Castle. You must survive after hitting the switch for the run to count. Make sure to include footage of you surviving after hitting the switch.

100% runs end on the frame the `You've completed everything in New Super Mario Bros. Wii!` textbox appears.

## Recording

Please record at minimum 30 fps and 480p. Excessive frame skipping, low bitrate, or audio cutting in and out may result in your run getting rejected.

Recording without a capture card is acceptable, but not preferred, and the recording requirements above still stand. **Runs recorded without a capture card that achieve a retime barrier will not be accepted,** so a capture card is highly recommended if you plan on taking this speedrun seriously.
