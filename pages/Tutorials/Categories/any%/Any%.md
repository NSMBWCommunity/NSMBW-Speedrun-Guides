# Any% 

With well over 1,000 runs on Speedrun.com, this is by far the most popular and competitive category in NSMBW. It is also the most beginner-friendly, making it a great place to start learning this speedrun!

Timing starts on your first input on the world map, i.e. pressing "right" to move to 1-1.
    *More specifically, the first frame mario turns or moves on the map.*

Timing ends when you hit the big switch at the end of 8-Castle.
    *Specifically the frame the "8000" appears from hitting the switch.*

Before hopping into a run, we recommend taking a look at each tutorial and getting confident with (at least) beginner strats in every level.
