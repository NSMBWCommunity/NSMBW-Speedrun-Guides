# 1-1 
While on the surface 1-1 is a pretty simple level it is a great level to start learning the intricacies of NSMBW movement. Sliding down slopes and running/jumping off rolling hills is used throughout this level to move faster than Mario's normal full running speed of 3 units/frame (referred to as "3 speed").

### Every level tutorial will include the following section for movement tips specific for that level. See [Movement](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/movement) for more detailed descriptions and tutorials for movement.
