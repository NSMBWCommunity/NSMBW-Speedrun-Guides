# 1-2
1-2 is a very straightforward level so it's only broken down to 2 tiers that are pretty similar. The "Beginner" tier of this level is what everyone does, and there is no reason to drop anything for a newer player. The "Expert" tier features a strat called Gzord kicks which saves a small ammount of time.

## Movement reminders & tips:
- With star, running down short and steep slopes as well as sliding are both slower.
- An exception to this rule is the tilting purple rock after the checkpoint because this platorm is actually moving.
- Using the tilt girders to make the smallest downward slope is fastest. Run on these with Star, and slide down without. To consistently tilt the platform to the first "tick" down, it helps to make sure you normally hold your wiimote level to the floor for the rest of the level.
