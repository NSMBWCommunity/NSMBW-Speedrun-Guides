This site offers a number of tutorials. Here you can navigate to tutorials for a category of your choice, or our full Movement Guide.

As of **January 2026**, the [Movement Guide](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/tutorials/movement/) is being worked on and the [Any%](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/tutorials/categories/any%25/) tutorial is complete. The other categories are a WIP, so for the time being we recommend watching runs at the time you want to achieve on [Speedrun.com](speedrun.com). Feel free to ask any questions you may have in the [Main NSMBW Speedrunning Server](https://discord.gg/pMKAaGscrh) or the site-specific [Tutorials Server](https://discord.gg/xMmfPyJ6Mh).
