Here you can find a number of tutorials. Before you start runs, please refresh yourself with the [Before Doing Runs](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/tutorials/before-runs/) guide. For category-specific guides, pick a category from the Table of Contents.

As of **February 2026**, the [Any%](https://nsmbwcommunity.github.io/NSMBW-Speedrun-Guides/tutorials/any%25/) tutorial is complete. The other categories are a WIP, so for the time being we recommend watching runs at the time you want to achieve on [Speedrun.com](speedrun.com/nsmbw). Feel free to ask any questions you may have in the [Main NSMBW Speedrunning Server](https://discord.gg/pMKAaGscrh) or this site's server, the [NSMBW Tutorials Server](https://discord.gg/xMmfPyJ6Mh).
