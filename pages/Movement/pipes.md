# Pipes

Dealing with pipes is simple once you learn how to enter and exit them properly in different scenarios.

## RTA Pipe Entering

RTA strategies are strategies used to optimize **real-time** speedruns, so *RTA Pipes* are the fastest way to deal with pipes. *IL pipes and strategies* optimize for in-game time, but are slower for real-time.

A pipe can face four directions. For **left and right facing pipes**, running into them normally is as fast as you'll get. Keep in mind you need to be on the ground by a pipe entrance for **10 frames** (0.16 seconds) before entering that pipe. Meaning, ideally you want to land on the ground about one two blocks before a horizontal pipe to enter it without waiting.

For **down-facing pipes**, you want to crouch jump into the middle of the pipe. Crouch jumping makes Mario's hitbox height smaller, thus making the pipe-entering animation shorter. Entering on the left or right edge of the pipe causes Mario to slowly align to the center of the pipe- much slower than Mario's running speed.

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #007bff;"></i> <i>Crouching as mini Mario does not change his hitbox, so crouching jumping into pipes isn't worth it because of the risk of losing speed while crouching on the ground.</i>

For pipes facing up, enter them as close to the middle as possible. Crouching into upwards-facing pipes has no effect.

## IL Pipe Entering

Entering pipes when optimizing for ILs is essentially the opposite of optimizing for RTA. 

Pipe animations and transitions pause the IGT so you want to enter pipes as soon as possible in ILs. This means no crouch jumping, and entering as far left/right as possible.

## Exiting Pipes

The optimal technique for exiting pipes is the same for all run types.

For **sideways pipes** do a small wallkick off of the pipe. We call these pipekicks. The wallkick you do, the faster you will accelerate. If you have fire, ice, or penguin, shoot fire/ice after you wallkick to get an acceleration boost.

For **down-facing pipes**, just fall. If you are high enough up and there is a wall opposite your desired direction, do a small wallkick off that wall as you fall out of the pipe.

For **upwards-facing pipes**, just run off unless there is a wall opposite to your desired direciton. If so, immediately do a small wallkick off the wall after you exit the pipe.

Pipes are the most common way Mario transitions between areas. The next most common are doors. These are pretty easy!
