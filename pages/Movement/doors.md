# Doors

Doors are everywhere in this game. Entering them optimally is very important, but easy to understand!

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #007bff;"></i> <i>*RTA* stands for *Real-Time Attack*, and refers to speedruns done in real time. *IL* stands for *Individual Level*. *IGT* refers to the *In-Game Timer* that appears in the top right corner of your screen while in a level.</i>

## RTA Doors

Again, these are the entrances we will be going for in real time runs. Essentially, we always want to **enter doors as early as possible *without* making Mario turn to the side** during his door entry animation.

This game has big and small doors but this rule applies to them both.

## IL Doors

For the most part, save these for ILs! **Enter the door as early as possible.** It can be helpful to buffer an `up` input as you approach a door to enter it as soon as possible.

<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size: 0.8em; color: #007bff;"></i> <i>Tower and Castle boss doors behave the same and are the same size. The same is true for ghost house doors and yellow dpad doors.</i>

Let's get a little more complex now! We'll next take a closer look at how moving platforms affect Mario's speed.
