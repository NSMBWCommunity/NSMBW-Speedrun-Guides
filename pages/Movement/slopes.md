# Slopes

It fastest to slide down slopes that are less steep than 45 degrees (if solid ground, only slide down 1x2 or 1x4 slopes).

When sliding down slopes it's usually important to slide on the ground after the slope for a bit to get full advantage of the slope speed. Looking at the speed display in the example videos and in your own practice can be a great way to get used to how far on the flat ground you should continue sliding.

For any slopes created by rotating blocks/platforms or rolling hills, slide down them as long as they are moving you in your desired direction and are less steep than 45 degrees. 

For **45 degree slopes**, it is fastest to run down these and slide at the last moment and on the flat ground for a bit.

Running up upwards slopes is slow so avoid them if possible. If you are forced to land on an upwards slope, jump off as quick as possible.

Now that we understand slopes, let's look at some information on jumping.
