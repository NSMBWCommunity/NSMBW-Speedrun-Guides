## Picking a Platform
In order to submit to the [official leaderboards](https://www.speedrun.com/nsmbw), you need to play on one of the supported platforms:
Physical Platforms
- Wii RVL 101 (Side Wii)
- Wii U (Physical)
- Wii RVL 001 (Gamecube Wii)

The only difference between the 3 platforms is load times dictated by the version of the disc drive in the wii. Side wiis have the best chance to have the fast 2:03 - 2:04 Disc drive, but they don't always have fast loads. In Any%, Low%, and Any% NoW5 loadless retimes are done after a time barrier.
In any other category you will get a real leaderboard advantage by having the fastest loads. Loads are usually refered to by a wii's any% loads.
### Average Any% Loads
- Wii RVL 101 (Side Wii): 2:03 - 2:06
- Wii U (Physical): 2:09 - 2:12
- Wii RVL 001 (Gamecube Wii): 2:10 - 2:15
